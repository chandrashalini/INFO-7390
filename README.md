**Using Machine Learning to Predict Subscription to Bank Term Deposits for Clients with Scikit-Learn**

Type of Machine Learning problem:
As you would have probably guess it by now, this is a binary classification problem. Our two classes are “yes” denoting that the customer subscribed to a term deposit, and “no” denoting that the customer did not subscribe.

In this project I will demonstrate how to build a model predicting clients subscribing to a bank's term deposit in Python using the following steps:
-data exploration

-feature engineering

-building training/validation/test samples

-model selection

-model evaluation

Project Definition

The classification goal is to predict if a client will subscribe to the bank term deposit (yes/no).
